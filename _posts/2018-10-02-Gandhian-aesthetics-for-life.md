Of most approaches why is Gandhian approach to life is more relevant today?

Gandhiâ€™s approach to life is sociocultural more than political.
Gandhian approach is based on three fundamentals- truth (satya), non-violence (ahimsa), ethics (neeti), which are not only conceptual frames but also virtual applications. But I would like to elaborate first the third fundamental, ethics.
The third principle of Gandhian philosophy, i.e. ethics (neeti) is highly potent and relevant. The policy of love for all is godly and it leads to building a godly culture where jealousy, conflict, selfishness would be substituted by cohesion, adjustment, inspiration and encouragement.
One, who believes in prayer or practises, is naturally a transformed man, a disciplined, calm and satisfied person and he being a theist becomes humble, learns to love others, which arouses love for the whole nature. Such man will nurture social culture based on purity of heart, truth and responsibility and which will inspire other societies. Slowly and gradually this will turn into a mighty stream.
Here man comes out of the dark aspects of behaviour and feels peace and happiness. Seen from Gandhian angle life is not individualistic but whole. Discipline and responsibility cannot be imposed from outside but they have to emerge from within. If it is so, then beauty of life can be gained or life will become beautiful. If we could adopt such viable and proven principles of the Gandhian philosophy, then certainly finding the basis of aesthetics for life will be easier because we would learn to live life as imbued in dharma  (living a life of duty and responsibility as primary objective  of life) rather than be forced to live like a solitary individual.
